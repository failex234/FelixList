# FelixList
Concept of Lists in Java that I wrote myself

Again this is nothing very useful or anything special!

You can use my code in any project but I doubt that anybody wants to use this.

Features:

- Dynamically add items to the List
- Dynamically remove items from the list
- Get Position of an Object in the List
- Contain-Check Method
- Easy Replace of any Object in the List
- Get Size of the List
